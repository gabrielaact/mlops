# Machine Learning Based Systems Design

## Identification & Affiliation

Gabriela Targino is a Computer Engineer student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Currently, she's enrolled in the course "Machine Learning Based Systems Design" taught by Professor Ivanovitch Silva.

## Introduction

Machine Learning is a powerful field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This GitHub repository is dedicated to the course "Machine Learning Based Systems Design," taught by Professor Ivanovitch Silva.

In this course, students will explore the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and various machine learning techniques. They will also learn how to design and implement machine learning-based systems for solving real-world problems.
