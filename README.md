## Introduction

Machine Learning is a dynamic field within artificial intelligence that has revolutionized the way we approach complex problems and data analysis. At its core, Machine Learning enables computers to learn patterns and make data-driven decisions without being explicitly programmed. This remarkable capability has opened up a world of possibilities across various domains.

In recent years, Machine Learning has found applications in a wide range of industries and disciplines. It has been instrumental in natural language processing, where it powers virtual assistants like Siri and chatbots, making human-computer interactions more natural and intuitive. In the healthcare sector, Machine Learning is used to analyze medical images, predict disease outbreaks, and assist in drug discovery.

To gain a deeper understanding of this field, this GitHub repository is dedicated to the course 'Machine Learning Based Systems Design,' taught by Professor Ivanovitch Silva, and it contains all projects developed for the subject.
